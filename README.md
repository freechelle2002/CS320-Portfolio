Software Testing Portfolio Reflection

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure my software is functional and secure by validating inputs, enforcing requirements and using unit tests to verify expected behavior.  Writing automated tests helps detect errors early and ensures the program continues to work correctly afer changes are made.  Tsting boundary conditions and preventing invalid data also helps protect the system from failures.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by carefully reviewing requirements and transitioning them into program rules and constraints.  In this course, this included enforcing character limits, preventing null values, and ensuring data integrity.  Understanding what the user expects helps guide how the program should behave and what validations are necessary.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by breaking problems into smaller components, implementing clear rules and testing each part to ensure it works correctly.  Writing tests alongside development helps verify functionality and makes debugging easier.   I also learned that revising and improving code is part of the design and leads to more reliable software.
